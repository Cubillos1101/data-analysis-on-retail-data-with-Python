## Online Retail Analysis
### Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of online retail data using Python. The goal is to analyze sales performance across different countries, detect anomalies, and visualize key insights through maps and charts.

### Features
**Data Analysis:**
- Grouping and summarizing sales data by country.
- Identifying top-performing countries in terms of total sales.
**Visualization:**
- Pie charts for sales distribution among top 10 countries.
- Interactive geographic visualizations to showcase country-level sales data.
**Data Cleaning:**
- Detection and removal of outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR).
**Geographic Integration:**
- Merging sales data with country boundaries for visualization.


### Requirements
To run the project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- geopandas

### Data Source
The analysis is based on a retail dataset provided in the online_retail.ipynb file. The dataset includes transactional data such as stock codes, descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and countries.

### Key Insights
- Identification of top-performing countries by sales.
- Detection of anomalies in sales quantities and unit prices.
- Creation of an interactive map highlighting sales distribution by country.

### Visualization Example
The project generates visualizations, including:
- Pie charts for sales distribution.
- Maps displaying total sales by country.
